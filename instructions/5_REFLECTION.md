# Final Assessment - Reflection

## Looking at the process of completing this assessment:

### 1. What did you do well

I enjoyed setting up the backend and first 2 features, it included everything I did earlier during practice assessments. Setting up the backend seems super easy and fetching all artworks and artwork by ID was something for which I had a clear understanding of how to write the login and also how to debug. But feature 3 which is incrementing heart at first looked very easy since we did a similar exercise in the classroom and it was there in assessment too but when I read about the patch I understood it's not that easy. I tried a lot of permutations and combinations referred to reader and google, this was challenging. Another interesting part is feature 4, where we have to make the bidding form available only when a user is logged, and there are so many maps and loops logic required, I had to write everything on paper first then understand how it can works then I executed one by one and I am super happy about it.

I took prinouts of the questions and tried to write the steps on it, it really helped to plan and excute steps.

### 2. What would you do differently next time to improve

Next time, I will practice everything by my hand so that I feel confident as I felt for the first 2 features and backend, super confident to write to code and debug if there are any errors. I also learned a lot of things while doing this assessment, which will of course help me next time.
