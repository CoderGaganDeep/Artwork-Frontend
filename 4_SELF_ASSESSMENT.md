| When a user is logged in we can see an number input for amount and button to `Bid`              | 1      | 1    |           |
| When the `Bid` button is pressed, it makes a POST request to the server to create a new `Bid`   | 2      | 1    |           |
| The bid created in the database has the correct `artworkId`                                     | 1      | 1    |           |

| The auth middleware is used on the server side to authorize the request, and the endpoint works | 1      | 1    |           |
| The minimum value of the input for amount in the frontend is the highest bid amount + 1         | 1      | 1    |           |
| If there are no bids yet the minimum value is the `minimumBid` value from the artwork           | 2      | 2    |           |
| The backend validates that the new bid is the highest bid so far                                | 2      | 2    |           |
